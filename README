QArpWatch
Simple interface that checks if the MAC address of your gateway is changed,
useful to detected arp poisoning.

Actually you need to be on clean network before run the software,
it can't detect if the network look suspicious, maybe in a future version.

Sorry for the icons, that come from Qt example. I don't have time to find cool icons.

Is the beggining of QArpWatch so if you want feature make a issue with your request or email me.

Last win32 build is availble here:

Warning:
Dependency to Qt4

git clone git://github.com/y0ug/QArpWatch.git
mkdir QArpWatchBuild

Don't have review on mac, I don't know if /proc/net/route exist and
have the same format as Linux


Some bugs may appear especially on windows, so feel free to report it.

Currently there is a small bug, if you don't use the network for some time,
the software can go in offline mode, don't worry if you launched a web page or
anything else, it returns to online mode
