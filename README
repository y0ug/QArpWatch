QArpWatch
Simple interface that checks if the MAC address of your gateway is changed,
usefull to detected arp poisoning.

Actually you need to be on clean network before run the software,
it can't detect if the network look suspicious, maybe in a future version.

Sorry for the icons, that come from Qt example. I don't have time to find cool icons.

Last win32 build is availble here:
https://github.com/downloads/y0ug/QArpWatch/QArpWatch.zip

Warning:
Dependency to Qt4

To build it:

git clone git://github.com/y0ug/QArpWatch.git
mkdir QArpWatchBuild
cd QArpWatchBuild
qmake ../QArpWatch
make
./QArpWatch


Ubuntu dep to build it
$ sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools

Don't have review on mac, I don't know if /proc/net/route exist and
have the same format as Linux


Some bugs may appear especially on windows, so feel free to report bugs.

Currently there is a small bug, if you don't use the network for some time,
the software can go in offline mode, don't worry if you launched a web page or
anything else, it returns to online mode
